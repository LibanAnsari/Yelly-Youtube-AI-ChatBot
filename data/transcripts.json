okay your password must include today's Wordle answer wait I don't know how to play Wordle get six chances to guess a felet word play how to play Guess the Wordle in six tries each guess must be a valid felet word the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word examples wary W is in the word and in the correct spot pills I is in the word but is in the wrong spot vague you is not in the word in any spot okay this is my first time playing hello do I click enter okay so there are letters H and O in the word that I'm supposed to guess holy the second letter is O definitely opening a notepad for this so H is not the first letter okay let's see words with o and H let's try something random donut none of those letters will it give me the answer if I guess incorrectly though okay bonus information Notch almost worked oh c h that's the word something o something c h could it be touch no it's not touch one more guess so it's not either of these letters that go in here or here it's not t n d or any other ones so it be couch let's see do we have a c or a u yes we have a u which means it's not couch let's see what letters I can use let's try with these ones did I just Google the alphabet that is correct so it seems like these are the letters that I can use and they're not gray out if I didn't miss any could it be porch P do we have a p here no do we have an R here okay my final guess is porch okay let's go porch first time playing Wordle ladies and mental gen your password must include a twetter symbol from the periodic table okay your password must include the current phase of the moon as an emoji phase of the moon what's the moon phase today so is it full moon or third quarter can I just try a bunch of emojis wait I forgot how to enable the emoji keyboard on Arch Linux meta Control Alt shift space Oh yes it's the finger breaking keyboard shortcut boom recent Emoji moon phase so it should be something like this I think boom your password must include the name of this country okay definitely looks European not a great geoguesser player let's go and explore oh there's some text here doesn't tell me much deole translate deole is a very good translator app by the way um biti monitor wait it's Italian Italy let's look for more text plus 355 is the number 355 country code Albania there you go your password must include the best move in algebraic chess notation oh here we go I have no idea what this is d8 is illegal move so why does it say d8 is it because I have d8 right here maybe algebraic notation is the standard method for recording and describing the moves in a game of chest so this is G5 okay so I need the best possible move oh this is going to be horrible I'm not Tyler 1 and I have no idea how to play chess wait I have to delete d8 I think so what is D can I remove it I can and do I still have to do the capture yes I do okay so how do I get rid of d8 without getting rid of the capture okay let's read the algebraic notation each piece other than pawns is identified by an uppercase letter English speaking players use the letters k for King Q for Queen R for Rook B for Bishop and N for Knight this is a bishop right B and then it goes to G7 let's just try this I have no idea if it's the right move G7 is illegal move oh it has to be capitalized invalid notation interesting what if my queen takes this Pawn is that good or bad then it's check but then this guy takes my queen and then what okay so Queen moves to H6 invalid notation I mean I'm pretty sure my queen can take this Pawn right how do you take a piece in chess let's watch this queen capture a pawn yes this should work my queen should be able to take this Pawn white to move thank God when a piece makes a capture an X is inserted immediately before the destination Square oh so Queen X and then H6 surely why can't my queen take H6 what if my knight or actually Rook takes H6 invalid oh the chess part is destroying me this password game is not very fun Mr Neil chat GPT what's the best chess move here is this cheating in the given chess position the best move for white is to play Queen takes H6 that was my original move so Queen takes H6 invalid notation Mr gbt Plus what's the plus what does plus mean check a move that places the opponent's king in check usually has the symbol plus oh so I have to try everything again okay so Rook takes H6 and that's also a check oh my God I feel so happy about that okay we need the cap chest so d8 here okay the digits in your p password must add up to 25 let's not embarrass ourselves 5 + 7 + 3 + 8 + 2 + 6 31 so I need to remove six which is either this six oh this is going to be horrible okay so these are already 23 + 6 that's more than 25 what is this two by the way so now they add up 2 29 what if I do - 10 - 4 doing minus doesn't work so how do I make it add up to 25 when it's already over 25 H this is impossible then is there some sort of a catch here can I divide by two no so what if I do four if I do four it still asks me to complete the capture I can reroll the Capt okay B5 NMM must include a leap year a leap year is every four years am I right so 2020 okay 2020 was a leap year now it's 4 10 15 that's 5 okay this is my chicken Paul he hasn't hatched yet please put him in your password and keep him safe this is getting weirder every second the elements in your password must have atomic numbers that add up to 200 the atomic number or nuclear charge number is the charge number of an atomic nucleus interesting so the atomic number is over here and we needed to add up to 200 is there one for 110 okay so we have DS DS and T8 for thorium oh but I also had gold in there the Roman numerals in your password should multiply to 35 don't they 7 * 5 which is 35 so where's the other Roman numeral here okay let's first get rid of rule 18 atomic numbers so thorium and darm Stadium I believe they add up to 200 no no oh the Roman numerals disappeared that's good news is a l and element aluminium so Al l in Albania is an l element then also s yes sulfur so we have sulfur 16 plus aluminum 13 plus whatever the hell this is V what's the element for V or vi v vadium 23 so that's 23 twice then we have iodine which is 53 twice that's 181 so I need 19 and 19 is potassium which is the letter K very nice all the vowels in your password must be bolded just B holding my password you know this is a password that I will definitely remember oh what's going on oh no your password's on fire quick put it out no wait how do I stop how do I put it out Paul has been slain no oh please don't make me do this again Neil this is not going to be fun if I have to do it again oh no can I just go back maybe okay hello your password must include the best move of course it must black to move so I'm black this time this is going to take years I don't want to cheat with the chat GPT here I'm using chat GPT it's been a while since I've been sitting at this board Queen overtakes H3 really oh I'm so happy now I thought of this at the beginning and thought it was nonsense that was the winning move are you kidding me the digits in your password must add up to 25 okay so we added three let's remove three beautiful this is my chicken Paul yes the elements in your password must have an atomic number that add up to 200 okay periodic table o what is this nice Google thing here it's interactive 201 it adds up to 201 does this I count as a Roman numeral oh I can just lowercase Indonesia okay your password must include a two-letter symbol from the periodic table so what if I do helium beautiful so now once again I have to add those up okay it's about to burn down again need to keep that in mind all the vowels in your password must be bolded okay let's bold everything and it's about to burn just delete the Flames when it burns delete the Flames okay here we go I was ready for that those Flames have brought me so much pain okay the digits in your password must add up to 25 so this was a two I think your password is not strong enough do I need to add a strength Emoji okay now it's strong enough your password must contain one of the following affirmations I am loved I am worthy I am enough okay I am worthy the vowels in your p password must be bolded the elements oh so it screws everything up I see must be bolded let's Bal them does it gatch on fire again so now we have an extra I here which is iodine 53 does it even fit no I am worthy will not work I am loved but all of them have iodine no all of them have iodine though so how the hell oh let's calculate again I'm going to need a notepad for this V is how much 23 I is iodine 50 53 24 I just need 24 which is chromium okay that worked the Roman numerals in your password should multiply to 35 let's not use the letter c which means I still need 24 so what if I do twice magnesium surely m is a Roman numeral yes it is of course let's do hydrogen 24 times boom Paul has hatched please don't forget to feed him he eats three every minute uh-oh let's just put a bunch of worms here just a bunch of them your password must include the URL of a 31 minute 26 second Long YouTube video Paul has over refed oh no and I died because Paul has overfed I have been fully defeated how long was this recording 1 hour 39 minutes where am I back at square one learned half of the periodic table I should have copied the password actually I give up today okay you know what I have one more try in me don't forget to extinguish the fire and do not overfeed the chicken it's very simple let me quickly speed run back to the place where I was in 30 seconds no it's 12:06 a.m. so there's a new Wordle answer oh my God no way hello oh this is going to take ages now filth H is in the correct spot what if I just fill it in doesn't tell me the answer I can't be bothered doing it again a wash what does it even mean covered or flooded with water especially seawat or rain no chance I would have guessed this word your password must include the name of this country okay where is the sun is it in the South the sun is really high up in the sky so it's probably near the equator somewhere wait it says the name on the ground I forgot let's type that in Colombia okay the Roman numerals in your password should multiply to 35 Colombia with a lower C oh here we go okay your password must include the best move in chess let's do one without Chad GPT surely I can this moves here surely it's that right so Rook moves to E8 and it's check that's not the best move so maybe I need to move it here to H6 H6 Tyler one ladies and gentlemen the digits in your password must add up to 25 okay so there's a six here which means we need to remove six that's four down and three yes oh theing chicken Paul has been slain what I pressed contrl Z and I didn't mean to remove Paul oh my God I pressed contrl Z just for no reason no must include the current phase of the moon that's an egg if I deleted the egg there and it would have reset it that would have been a rich quit your password must include the name of this country okay this is like Rome Italy what does the English text say Jordan Museum beautiful oh great I'm just going to use chat GPT for this there's no chance wait I can't upload an image enable to upload the image great what if do Knight G4 plus E4 yes it was Knight E4 okay must add up to 25 so this turns into a one this is my chicken pole okay don't slay the chicken let's just put it here at the start beautiful all the vowels in your password must be bolded and then I have to extinguish the fire extinguish the fire extinguish the fire extinguish the fire right now easy your password is not strong enough let's just put 1 2 3 your password must continue on the foll affirmations okay I am worthy again the vels need to be bolded okay Paul has hatched please don't forget to feed him he eats three every minute how do I not forget this 1 2 3 okay now there's two so is he okay with two will he overe eat now I'm scared okay 1 2 3 okay we just have to keep three here nice your password must include a URL of a 22 minute 58 second long video 22 minutes 58 seconds how to filter YouTube videos by length advanced search for YouTube the Chrome web store doesn't exist great what if I just add this URL like just a random URL it actually checks you have to be kidding me does this work it says 22 minutes and 56 seconds of nothing but it's wait surely this works yes okay yes thank you Mr Mega that's the video save it for later in case I forget to feed the worm now this introduced a bunch of  oh no is this a possible game to complete this is not fun Mr Neil not fun at all my keyboard disconnected please please please please feed the chicken this is far from fun okay look at the amount of new elements that have been introduced how am I supposed to add those up to 200 it's impossible can I just lowercase them k h doesn't work why do I have to keep feeding the chicken it's so annoying then we have y p and okay then we have Paul has been slain I accidentally clicked contr X instead of contrl V I'm feeling pain all over my body there's so much pain I don't like how misleading the name of this website is this is over today it's just over okay it's the next day let's go to neil. fun and continue the game oh there are many games the password game first let's do something strategic and open up the periodic table and let's try to figure out how I would have done this link so that it adds up to 200 so these are all the elements in this YouTube link I'm pretty sure next time it's going to be a different link so I'm not even going to bother remembering everything and I also have these elements two v's one i n and one n i I think there's no chance this adds up to less than 200 Let's test it out though tungsten 74 no chance so all of these numbers already add up to more than 200 I'm pretty sure yes so then when I insert the URL how am I supposed to make it so they add up to 200 it's literally impossible because if I change the URL the video inside of the password game changes as well will it work if I put it inside of Link shortener world's shortest URL shortener let's try this okay and this only has letters and only one element surely it will work right surely here we go what else do we need a calculator do I have like a automatic calculator app oh I know how to do this sheets. new okay so now we have all the elements here as well I never thought I'd need Google Sheets for this can I split text to columns custom perfect so here we have the elements of the periodic table and here I can have calculations of them for example here beautiful so this is the sum of our current Elements which are all over here so I don't need this anymore let's leave it here beautiful we have the URL shortener we have the spreadsheet Wordle answer oh yes a wash a wash beautiful so this time I'm coming prepared choose a password must include a special character month of the year July for some reason my keyboard randomly disconnects I hope it doesn't disconnect when there's one worm left to feed the the chicken Pepsi okay let's do a simple capture oh yes okay PC d e that's really good your password must include today's Wordle answer which is a wash two letter symbol from the periodic table let's do helium your password must include the current phase of the moon as an emoji boom must include the name of this country Zone Electronics Noir store International Liberia something Liberia it is Liberia the Roman numerals okay Liberia lowercase beautiful must include a leap here zero is a Le here makes so much sense didn't think about that before your password must include the best move of course of course Bishop moves to D6 and it's also check invalid notation no problem Bishop takes G6 check nope what if my Rook goes to d8 and also it's Check Yes okay your password must include a URL of a 17-minute 50c YouTube video God damn it that's 51 seconds oh does it work will it work please work it worked okay okay okay okay contrl x a sacrifice must be made pick two letters that you will no longer be able to use let's do that after the YouTube video so this put it into the URL shortener we have a link with a bunch of capital letters I hope it's not a problem copy feed Paul no I can't shorten it okay how much stuff does this link have this link has so much stuff oh no what letters do I want to sacrifice let's sacrifice Mt KSF I is there an H somewhere okay there's no h H so let's sacrifice H and then let's also sacrifice what else Q is Q There Q is not here okay let's sacrifice H and Q sacrifice beautiful a sacrifice must be made pick two letters that you will no longer be able to use I just did though oh there's a bunch of H's here so I can't use them not great can I you know restart it no problem what if my Rook moves to E8 and check okay digits and the password must add up so let's do Z and two this is my chicken Paul Here We Go Again elements in your password must have an atomic number that adds up to 200 r e we have another element that's r e please don't have a large atomic number 75 no can I roll this should I just restart the game because it's 75 I think I'm restarting the game no chance I can do 75 oh it's a very helpful that this button is here how helpful password game became so much easier now it's going to be the Fire password is not strong enough password must contain one of the following let's do worthy bold the vowels and Paul is about to hatch of course Mr Paul please get lucky on the YouTube video 26 minutes 45 seconds o that looks rough yoink all right there's not too many elements let's hope they don't have massive atomic numbers so let's delete our H and the letters C oh now we can't have Roman numerals because they don't multiply to 35 C Roman numeral it's 100 but it's impossible then do I have to put it inside of a URL shortener or something but it doesn't accept them YouTube shorten URL free URL shortener shorten URL so this is the URL does it work can I add https colon double slash no doesn't work so if I can shorten a URL and then there are a bunch of symbols like this inside the URL do I have to just restart the game until I get a lucky YouTube url the password game YouTube url how do you do it but this link is short look at how long my link is let's try to find another video okay maybe this works better boink 47 seconds please be a short link oh list of Roman numerals okay we have V we can't have X as well and we can't have M do we have an X we don't okay that's good we don't have a c and we can't have a d how much is D 500 please no D okay there's no D maybe that's good I think the Roman numeral rule might work here we have five here and we have an i which is 1 so 5 * 1 is 5 and then it needs to be times 7even like this no so that's five here then there's one here which makes everything also five and there's five here so that's 25 why are there two fives and it's inside of the link essentially to win this game I have to get lucky on the YouTube url thing there's no other way I just have to get lucky that this URL will not have Roman numeral or elements in the periodic table that will screw up all the other rules so I have to restart this die Paul just die how to win password game YouTube url Reddit the first comment oh no Paul the next comment first time I accidentally deleted him when the password caught on fire second time forgot about the food and he died third time I decided to paste a bunch of worms to avoid him being dead and he died of overfeeding sounds familiar I thought I deleted PA there don't do that all the vowels must be bolded can I just bold everything then no delete oh po has hatched 32 minutes and 24 second okay this is just pure luck please get lucky on the YouTube video o i see a lot of letters there maybe I can copy from here okay I don't think there's a Roman numeral this can be the one and these are separate links I should have done it through there and not through the share button okay okay okay valuable information Y is an element for sure 39 yes let's put it in there and then we also have ZN which is zinc I think zinc is 30 okay oh never mind I was so happy everything adds up to 270 there's no way to get rid of them because I would be altering the URL great it's impossible because the Roman numerals in your password should multiply to 35 and I can't really multiply a th000 by anything to get 35 so we need another link well it seems like we have to commit commit Paul name of this country well this is a cave wait can I not walk oh that's bad if I can't walk don't sabotage me like this okay we can read those words Ki KI cave Malaysia surely it's Malaysia it is Malaysia okay easy chess move should be easy as well let's do Rook to h8 and plus good digits in your password must add up to 25 so let's leave it at two Paul is the chicken or H is an element please don't be a horrible element 45 not the best we only need seven more there's no chance this is going to work oh what is that oh wo wo wo wo wo relax relax please relax okay ways to write six in Roman numerals wait seven he's hungry he's hungry no yes okay just a little gem scare is there another way to write seven not like this can I write Rook somehow else can I do a rook Emoji of course I can't so I have to restart this we have a Clash of Clans video don't disappoint please we have helium that's very good that's not helium that's hydrogen great chemistry that's one wh this sounds like a lot oh tungsten it's 74 nope can we have another 20 minute 39 second video this might work okay we have S sulfur 16 is that doable no God damn it 20 minute fat burning workout perfect just what I was looking for and we have B and K Boron is five and K is 19 H fad burning workout not going to happen this might work age restricted and only available on YouTube well that's great and Paul has been slain that does make me happy okay this is going to be the final try well this is future me I decided to give the game one last try and this was the final try because I thought finding the YouTube url was just lug based and actually on this try that lasted 2 hours and 11 minutes I managed to beat the game let's look at my reaction here oh my God I am so happy but as you can see the thing that you're seeing on the screen is the lock screen of my computer this whole entire try was just this lock screen this pissed me off so much because here you can see that there's not much space where I was talking and that's because one of the tasks in the password game were that I had to include the current time so here I waited for like 45 minutes so that I can include the time 2 minutes past midnight and I just sat there and fed the chicken this whole entire time but then I import this footage inside of Premier Pro and lo and behold I'm looking at my lock screen 2 hours 11 minutes of footage just completely removed you have no idea how mad I am now that I'll have to try this again one of the other tasks was that I needed to include a hex code of a color that it generated and for that I had to install an app on Arch Linux that would let me pick a color and to install that app I had to update update my entire operating system because it wouldn't let me launch it and then once I did that Firefox the browser I was using updated as well and it didn't let me Google anything so I lost the ability to Google which added another challenge on top and I still managed to beat the game and yeah here's the recording everybody I'm so excited to play this game again this time I'm not going to do it inside of Arch Linux of course I have my Google spreadsheet where I'm calculating all the stuff not sure if I recorded this or not but essentially this is a spreadsheet with a bunch of chemical elements and their atomic numbers and this tells me how much is needed still so it totals to 200 this is the wle answer and this is the phase of the moon for this we need all letters hopefully lowercase yes must include today's world answer which is this no it's not I cannot be bothered doing Wordle one more time juice best move in the algebraic chest notation maybe it's this guy takes the queen illegal move oh black to move I wasn't playing the right side of okay Mak sense what if I move my queen here Queen goes to D4 check that's not the best move let's just try Rook to E4 and check okay the digits in your password must add up to 25 The Classic this is Paul the elements in your password must have okay so this is i n delete helium no there's re e here this is bad because re e is 75 so that's like a lot which means we already have 223 I need the chess move to have nothing to do with a rook so let let's just restart this no problems I have restarted this many times before okay that's a different country Banda Street Singapore no it's not jwat Towers Beirut Restaurant Beirut is capital and the largest city of Lebanon Lebanon what everything is weirdly English here kimti Street Kenya it is not there's no way I can't guess this country 0799 is the country code it's Kazakhstan it is not Kenya is this Kenya it was Kenya wow that was hard a sacrifice must be made pick two letters that will no longer be able to use let's put it here find letters for example H okay there's no G here Q there's not a q which is great Paul has been slain oh not sure how that happened it was an accident let's do this again password must include a URL of a 25 minute and 13 second YouTube video please don't be a bad link boom we have a 0 five which is good and 38 not horrible so we have to get rid of one of the fives and then we need to get rid of three and then we need to get rid of eight so five that's 10 and this has to become three sacrifice two letters double check what we need to sacrifice so we can no longer use Z and L sacrifice your password must contain twice as many italic characters as bold let's bold every vowel up until the start of India everything will be italic beautiful at least 30% of your password must be in the windings font so we can turn June Pepsi and this into wingdings and we can turn the word YouTube India into wingdings and we're good your password must include this color so we are ideally looking for a color with not that many numbers this should not be that horrible maybe it is quite horrible no numbers okay at least 30% must be in the windings font I am worthy can become windings the valve must be bolded so e has to be bolded oh no there are a bunch of elements that just got added however I can turn these into lower case yes all Roman numerals must be in the Times New Roman font so these ones Times New Roman this Times New Roman don't forget to feed the chicken the font size of every digit must be equal to its Square okay so let's first write down all the digits here because they're going to disappear very quickly so 3 0 6 0 5 3 8 and of course the sum of these is 25 now the problem is that I can only get rid of three here all the other numbers are necessary so 3 squar is 9 0 squar is 0 0 squar is 0 6 2ar is 36 5 squ is 25 32 is 9 and 8 squar is 64 boink every instance of the same letter must have a different font size this will kill me later when I'll have to retype the entire password beautiful okay let's copy all of this and paste it in here so we have some backup your password must include the length of your password which also needs to be a prime number that's one of the later rules so prime numbers Paul has starved I forgot about him I never forget Paul but I did let's just do this one more time no problemos no problems oh I was almost at the end there as well now the numbers are 307 054 4 six okay and these should add up to 25 yes they do okay nice very this is the final try I'm not trying anymore I can't I just can't with this game this is the chicken Paul that I've slain way too many times by accident Paul has hatched that's great news well I guess I'm going to have to do this I mean pain mental all sorts of pain actually let's just restart keeps giving me these hard countries let's restart again we have the letter C in here which is bad I delete like this it doesn't trigger the next rule which is really good Roman numerals great oh I deleted it again okay okay you know what goodbye I am rage quitting boom here we go okay so now I'm at a point where I need to feed the chicken and find the YouTube video 5 minute and 21 second video 5 minutes and 21 seconds please be a good URL no Roman numerals no nothing are there Roman numerals yes there are Roman numerals for some reason if I'm on Mac OS and I delete something by selecting it entirely it prompts me the Rule 25 which makes me remove two letters from my password that I can never use but the problem is that now I don't know what letters will be in the next URL are there Roman numerals in this URL there's so many capital letters but I don't think there are Roman numerals and there are no numbers so this might be really good okay let's paste in the password and see what letters we haven't used Z so we can ban z r oh there's no R that's good R sacrifice this is one of the most annoying Parts because my password must include this color in HEX essentially hex is basically this it's hashtag and a bunch of letters and numbers ideally I want to roll this and keep rerolling this until there are no numbers in the hex code because I can write the hex code in lowercase letters I can't remove numbers and if there are numbers it's going to screw everything else up this little maneuver will probably take 50 years 52 CBD let's do this one just why not paste it in then let's lowercase the CB and D remove the five here because there's a five here remove the three and now everything adds up to 25 wait I have to keep these letter letter is capitalized 152 CBD this is the hex color though wait what why doesn't it count do I have to capitalize these but I can't have the letter C in there the capital letter C because it's a Roman numeral wait wait wait wait wait we need the wingdings font so let's do com as wingdings as well but that is the hex code though hex code this and it gives me the same blue color let's take a screenshot here put it inside Affinity photo and if I pick this color this is the hex code oh it's different what how is it different so it's #t 0 c2d C5 we can work with that so let's lowercase the C the D then make sure everything adds up to wait this was 3555 I think it was like this so there's a two added in a five I can remove a five and turn this into one okay beautiful all Roman numerals must be in Times New Roman Times New Roman very nice the font size of every digit must be equal to its Square so if it's one the square of 1 is 1 if it's five wait before doing this don't forget to write down all all the numbers it's going to be useful later okay so now all of these numbers should add up to 25 that is correct and so now let's make them smaller 1 squ is 1 5^ s 25 oh here we go one of the most annoying parts except for having to retype the entire password at the very end that's the last task every instance of the same letter must have a different font size so essentially I have to select each one and choose a different font size isn't that fantastic just some torture why not oh I don't have a mouse with me right now doing this on a trackpad is horrible my finger is getting friction burned right now and boom okay the font size of every digit must be equal to its Square okay so now this two needs to be four beautiful your password must include the length of your password and also one of the rules later will be that the password will have to be a prime number so I need a prime number to be the length prime numbers list let's do 113 so let's aim for the length to be 113 okay then the square of three is 9 and the square of 1 is 1 also this adds to the list of numbers so 1 1 three which means I need to remove four so this five turns into one and then this one also needs to become smaller like this beautiful wait they don't add to 25 they add to 30 I have one five then another five somewhere where's the other five I just deleted the five and now it works I need a four instead of a five oh okay okay I see instead of this five I need a four because there's probably a one somewhere else maybe not 100% confidence let's actually increase the font size of everything to 42 and see if there's a one somewhere yes there was a one at the very beginning okay okay okay let's contrl Z no if this is a six then all numbers add up to 25 okay every instance of the same letter must have a different font size and your password must include the length of your password which needs to be 113 so I'm just going to add a bunch of periods at the end okay every instance of the same letter must have a different font size so let's make this 32 beautiful okay now this rule is horrible your password must include the current time but if you include the current time you know what happens there are a bunch of numbers in that time which screws up all the other numbers so last time I saw this rule I had to wait 40 minutes until it hit after midnight however now I don't really want to feed the chicken for 6 more hours so the secret ingredient to beating this rule is called crime essentially I can stop my computer from setting the time automatically and set it manually That's What You Get Me Mr Neil okay so now I can remove the six so my time could be numbers that add up to 6 which is 3:03 p.m. or something like that let's do 303 p.m. but before I set it I'm also going to delete these 303 p.m. then I have to make this 3 font size 9 and this font size one and this three font size 9 as well next I'm going to copy my entire password and save it somewhere so that I can paste it in later because I will have to retype the entire thing for this game to complete boink everything digit must be equal to its square but it is though okay the three needs to have font size 9 another three needs to have font size 9 and zero needs to be font size zero I can remove this six beautiful it's coming together nicely copy that one more time feed the chicken now let's set the current time to 303 boom is this your final password yes oh my God yes hopefully it will let me copy and paste this in please okay now I just need to turn all of the these red ones into wingdings font beautiful wait why are they still red they shouldn't be red maybe the font size is slightly off I think it's the same does it have to be bold yes okay so these have to be bold makes a lot of sense okay so all I need to do now is just retype the password and I completed the game again this is going to feel so good let me get to work here we go set this font size to zero boom Oh my God congratulations you have successfully chosen a password in 100 3 characters this is my password okay I can finally close out everything and set my time and date automatically I beat this game twice now and this ladies and gentlemen is my password beautiful I'm going to put how long it took on the screen I expected to complete this game in 10 maybe 15 minutes it took this long but I'm so happy I did it okay there's just one thing that I completely forgot to mention Psych"
